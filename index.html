        <h1>Pyber Project</h1>
        <p>The goal of the Pyber Project is represent data analysis from two sources.
            The analysis took place in a jupyter notebook using Python as the language.
            The Dependencies imported were Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy.  </p>
        <p>First I imported the City CSV and Ride CSV as DataFrames. 
            After reading the CSVs I merged the data on the common column, city.</p>
        <p>Usuing Panadas I grouped data by the type of city (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) and city 
            when preforming calculations for the number of rides, the average fare and number of drivers.</p>
        <p>I created a scatter plot using Matplotlib. Color coding indiviudal cities
            by the type of city showed trends among the types of city. 
            By setting the size of the point to the number drivers in a city
            we are able to see how the supply of drivers interacts with number of rides
            and the average fare in a city.</p>
        <p>The last part of the analysis was to create Pie Charts representing the data 
            through pie charts. This allowed for more singular analysis of the variables.
